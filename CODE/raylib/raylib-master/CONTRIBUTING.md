## Contributing to raylib

Hello contributors! Welcome to raylib! 

This document contains a set of guidelines to contribute to the project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. 
Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull-request.

### raylib philosophy

 - raylib is a tool to enjoy videogames programming, every single function in raylib should be a tutorial on itself.
 - raylib is SIMPLE and EASY-TO-USE, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex or is not clearly useful, better not to include it.
 - raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to TEACH videogames programming completely by free.
 - raylib is collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code-examples / bugs-solving / code-comments are highly appreciated.
 - raylib's license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using it for commercial products.

### Some interesting reads to start with

 - [raylib history](HISTORY.md)
 - [raylib architecture](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-architecture)
 - [raylib license](LICENSE.md)
 - [raylib roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
 
[raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki) contains some information about the library and is open to anyone for edit. 
Feel free to review it if required, just take care not to break something.

### raylib C coding conventions

Despite being written in C, raylib does not follow the standard Hungarian notation for C, 
it [follows Pascal-case/camel-case notation](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-coding-conventions), 
more common on C# language. All code formatting decisions have been carefully taken
to make it easier for students to read, write and understand code. 

Source code is extensively commented for that purpose, raylib primary learning method is:

 > learn by reading code and examples

For detailed information on building raylib and examples, please check [raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki).

### Opening new Issues

To open new issue for raylib (bug, enhancement, discussion...), just try to follow these rules:

 - Make sure the issue has not already been reported before by searching on GitHub under Issues.
 - If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a 
 title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
 - If applies, attach some screenshot of the issue and a .zip file with the code sample and required resources.
 - On issue description, add a brackets tag about the raylib module that relates to this issue. 
 If don't know the module, just report the issue, I will review it.
 - You can check other issues to see how is being done!

### Sending a Pull-Request

 - Make sure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
 - Don't send big pull-requests (lots of changelists), they are difficult to review. It's better to send small pull-request, one at a time.
 - Verify that changes don't break the build (at least on Windows platform). As many platforms where you can test it, the better, but don't worry
 if you cannot test all the platforms.

### raylib bindings

Some people ported raylib to other languages in form of bindings or wrappers to the library, here is a list with the ones I'm aware of:

 - [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) : raylib **C/C++** version (default)
 - [raylib-lua](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-lua) : raylib **Lua** binding
 - [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) : raylib **Go** binding
 - [raylib-Nim](https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/raylib-Nim) : raylib **Nim** binding
 - [cray](https://gitlab.com/Zatherz/cray) - raylib **Crystal** binding
 - [Graphics::Raylib](https://metacpan.org/pod/Graphics::Raylib) : raylib **Perl** wrapper
 - [raylib-pascal](https://github.com/drezgames/raylib-pascal) - raylib **Pascal** binding
 - [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) : raylib **C#** binding
 - [RaylibSharp](https://github.com/TheLumaio/RaylibSharp) : raylib **C#** binding

 - [raylib-java](https://github.com/XoanaIO/raylib-java) : raylib **Java** binding
 - *[raylib flat-assembler Usage example](http://forum.raylib.com/index.php?p=/discussion/comment/425/#Comment_425)*
 - *[raylib COBOL Usage example](https://github.com/Martinfx/Cobol/tree/master/OpenCobol/Games/raylib)*
 
Usually, raylib bindings follow the convention: `raylib-{language}`

Let me know if you're writing a new binding for raylib, I will list it here and I usually 
provide the icon/logo for that new language binding.
