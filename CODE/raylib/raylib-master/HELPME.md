help me!
--------

Iâ€™m working hard on raylib but my resources are quite limited. If you enjoy raylib and want to help / contribute in some way, 
please, [let me know][raysan5].

The following help is highly appreciated:

	- C programming - Can you write / review / test / improve the code? 
	- Documentation / Tutorials / Example writters - Can you write some tutorial / example?
	- Web Development - Can you help with the web? SEO, style, code writting: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.com
	- Porting to Linux, OSX, RaspberryPi, consoles... - Can you compile and test raylib on another systems?
	- Testers of current features and multiple systems - Can you find some bug on raylib?

If you can not help on any of the above points but you still want to contribute in some way... please, consider helping 
with a small [donation](http://www.raylib.com/helpme.html) or contributing with [raylib patreon](https://www.patreon.com/raylib). It will really motivate to continue improving this project...

raylib philosophy
------------------

   * raylib is a tool to enjoy videogames programming, every single function in raylib should be a tutorial on itself.
   * raylib is SIMPLE and EASY-TO-USE, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex or has not a clear usefulness, better not to include it.
   * raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to TEACH videogames programming completely by free. 
   * raylib is collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code-examples / bugs-solving / code-comments are highly appreciated.
   * raylib's license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using it for commercial products.
